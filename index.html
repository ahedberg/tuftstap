			<p>Welcome to the Tufts Tap Ensemble website! We are the only dance 
			group at Tufts devoted to tap dancing. Each semester, we stage a 
			show featuring a variety of pieces which are choreographed, taught, 
			and performed by students. Our shows are open to Tufts students and 
			performed on campus. We are active within the Tufts dance community, 
			guest-performing in shows for Sarabande, BEATs, and the Amalgamates. 
			We are also active in the greater Boston area and have performed with 
			tappers from BU, Brandeis, and Harvard.</p>

			<p>Auditions for Tap Ensemble are held each semester. Prior tap 
			experience is necessary to join, but we offer student-run workshops for 
			anyone who wishes to learn. If you have any questions about our group, 
			contact the Tap Ensemble directly at tuftstap [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>
